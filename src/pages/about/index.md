a person employed to provide a natural environment conducive to the propagation of game

\- I will mainly be using this blog as a platform to review games and write about different board game mechanisms, my likes and dislikes of those mechanisms and stand out games of that type.

\-I will be focusing mainly on light games, gateway games and gateway plus games.

\-My reviews are most likely going to be for games I enjoy and want to recommend to the reader, leaving it to my posts discussing mechanisms to highlight games I did not like.
