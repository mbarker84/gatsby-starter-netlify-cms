  Welcome to a new corner of board game write-ups and reviews. Looked after by
  The Game Keeper. I have compiled a list of 10 accessible games with a range of
  player counts and mechanisms, my hope is that there is something here for
  everyone. I like all these games, so this is less of a review and more of an
  explanation of how the games work, so you can decide if any interest you.


  Please note, all prices correct at time of posting...

## 1. Bohnanza

#### For 2-7 players

![Bohnanza box](/img/bohnanza-01.jpg)

Beans aren't just something you can plant in the ground to grow a stalk that rises up to a Giant's castle in the clouds. They can be much more exciting than that. In Bohnanza, you and up to seven friends can trade beans with each other, collecting sets in what is a simple and compelling card game. Sit down with plenty of drink, great conversation and a clever sociable game where you're trying to strike deals and barter with your fellow farmers. 

Everyone has a hand of cards (beans) and the real hook of the game is that you aren't allowed to rearrange the order of your hand. At the beginning of your turn you play the first and possibly the second beans from your hand in front of you (Planting them), with the aim, as the game progresses, to have them join other cards of the same bean type. Then you reveal two bean cards from the deck and you can plant these yourself or try and trade them, along with unwanted cards in your hand, with the other players. If you can’t trade the two cards from the deck, you must plant them. But you're only allowed a few types of bean in front of you at any one time and any new types of bean you're forced to plant, replace your hard earned plantations, forcing you to sell them (and discard them) before they've earned you peak coins (victory points). 

![Bohnanza cards](/img/bohnanza-02.jpg)

*Our stack of 4 planted coffee beans are worth one coin if we sell them, but if we can collect 12, they will be worth four coins! We only need two Soy Beans to sell for one coin, but there are only twelve Soy Bean cards in the deck, compared to twenty four coffee beans.* 

During your opponents turns you're frantically trying to trade, or give away, the cards in your hand that you don't want so that when your turn comes round again, the first and second cards in your hand are ones that you want to plant in front of you to swell your collection.

Conclusion: Just the game you've bean waiting for. This game may look old school, but its a lot of fun. Friends and family will have a great time wheeling and dealing with each other, forging temporary alliances and rivalries. But take note, this can be a bit of a runner usually lasting an hour. But it’s really fun so you wont mind. The two player game changes the rules and flow slightly but I have still found it enjoyable, though there will be better games for two coming up in this blog. This game will sing if you have 4-6 players.

*Unfortunately at the time of posting, I could not find a store with Bohnanza in stock, but i'm sure it will be available again very soon,*

## 2. Animals on Board

#### For 2-4 players

One of the Bible's more believable stories is about a man who takes two of every one of the millions of animals on earth and puts them on a single boat. Animals on board replicates this, with an I-cut-you-choose mechanism, but you'll only need to make room for about 12 animals. 

Each round, a veritable smorgasbord of animal tiles will be placed in a big group in the centre of the table. The first player simply splits the group, like Moses parting the red sea, in to two groups however they wish and then takes a food token from the supply (Not like Moses). With there now being two groups of animal tiles, the next player selects one of those groups and splits that into two, taking a food token. On a turn a player can, instead of splitting a group of animals, opt to snag a group of animals like.....John the Baptist, by paying food tokens equal to the number of animals in the group and placing said animals on their marvellous 3D ark.

Once everyone's bought a group (The last player only gets one more turn to buy one, so may end up without a group) the round ends and more tiles are placed in the centre and play continues. There's five of each animal in the game, with each numbered 1 to 5. If you end the game with a solitary animal of a type eg. one Tortoise, it scores you the number on the tile. But if you get three or more of a type of animal, they score you 5 points each! But beware, a pair of animals of a type wont score you any points because Noah takes them from you and murders them probably. 

![Animals On Board animal tiles](/img/animals-on-boards-01.jpg)

*Our Giraffe and Zebra currently provide us 7points. But we're gonna need another Tiger or those will be worth zero*

The key to the game is making the animal types you want less appealing to others, so you can grab them with your food tokens. But you must be careful how you split to ensure other groups that are formed are not too profitable for other players.

Conclusion: Flood your table with friends and disciples, this game is simple and fun. Kids will enjoy this game, but once they've gone to bed, the adults will be wanting to carry on. Interesting choices to make, with a small amount of luck thrown in. Best with 3 or 4 players. I wouldn’t blame you buying a pair of copies, though Noah might steal them.

## 3. Sushi Go Party (Or Sushi Go)

#### For 2 - 8 players (Or 2 to 5)

![Sushi Go box](/img/sushi-go-01.jpg)

Rice to the occasion in Sushi Go, a drafting game where players will pick and pass sushi for varying victory points. 

Players are dealt a hand of cards depicting sushi type dishes with each dish having a different way of scoring you points at the end of the round. Each player chooses a card from their hand and places it in front of them to keep. All players reveal the kept card simultaneously and pass the rest of the hand of cards to the player on their left. Everyone selects a card from the new hand of cards, picking and passing cards until the hands have reduced to nothing. Here are some examples of scoring; Nigiri cards give you the small amount of points shown on the card. A wasabi card does nothing on its own, but later in the round if you keep a nigiri card, it will triple the points of that nigiri. Maki rolls have a number of icons on them. Whoever has accumulated the most icons at the end of the round gets 6 points. Second most gets 3 points. Sashimi are worth nothing if you end the round with one or two of them, but if you can get three you score 10 points. Once the scores have been totalled for the round, more cards are dealt out and play continues. The player with the most dessert cards scores points, but only at the very end of the game.

![Sushi Go cards](/img/sushi-go-02.jpg)

Conclusion: Sushi Go is a really engaging game with plenty of decisions to make. Some cards are going to give you points easily, while with others you will be pushing your luck a bit and hoping there are multiple cards of that type in circulation. The dish names and the adding up involved might make the game sound more complicated than it is. It’s a beautiful design and it wont take long for you to pick up how each dish scores from the symbology on the card. 'Sushi Go Party' includes an extensive range of dishes so you can pick and choose a menu of which card types you would like to be in your game to mix things up a bit. Wheras the smaller, cheaper 'Sushi go' just has the exact number of cards to play the game and it will always have those same types. This game is delicious, pass it on.

## 4. The Mind

#### For 2 - 4 players

Can you count on your friends? Can you count? Can you? You?

The Mind is a deck of cards numbered 1-100. Deal each player a card. One player say's "Begin" and players must simply play all the cards face up on to the table in ascending order without saying anything to each other. If you succeed, shuffle the deck and try giving each player two cards each. See how many cards per player your group can climb to. Three? Six? Five? If you want to mix things up, have players play all their cards face down and reveal them in the order played for an extra level of tension

![The Mind cards](/img/the-mind-02.jpg)

Conclusion: The mind is barely a game. Its an activity. You and your friends will gradually develop an unspoken timer. Waiting, waiting, waiting, feeling the moment when you must play your card/s. You're holding card 31, your mind races "Too much time has passed, we must be in the thirties now! Maybe?" You will fail. A lot. But you'll be playing again once the decks had a reshuffle. It doesnt sound fun when the rules are explained, but it's tense.When you succeed it feels great, you will laugh at your friends and you will shout at your friends. If it clicks with your group you can play it anywhere. Up the pub, on the train. And you will play it again and again and again and again....

## 5. Lost Cities

#### For 2 players

Only the bravest explorers are invited to play expedition cards in five colours ranging in values between 2 and 10. Certainly not for the faint hearted. 

In Lost Cities two players take it in turns to play a card, then draw a card. Playing a colour card for the first time will start your expedition of that colour. For the remainder of the game, cards of that colour are stacked on to that card and they must be of a higher value than the previous card. The aim of the expedition is to have the cards total more than 20 and you will score victory points for how high above 20 the expedition totals. So if your yellow cards total 32, the expedition will score you twelve points. The difficulty being, you start the game with extremely limited information, just the cards in your hand, and if your expedition does not total 20 at the end of the game, you score minus points equal to the deficit. All the while your opponent is trying to build up their own expeditions. 

![Lost Cities cards](/img/lost-cities-01.jpg)

*Here we have an excellent green expedition. Current total 22, so this will give us 2 points at the end of the game (Doubled to 4 points because of the handshake card). But we will be hoping to snag the 9 or 10 green cards to really ramp our score. However, our opponent has started their own green expedition with the Green 2, so we're slightly worried they might be holding the 9 and/or 10 in their hand.*  

You must play a card every turn, so if the cards in your hand are not ideal for placing to your expeditions, or are a colour you don't really want, you can play a card to that colours discard pile. But your opponent may use their end-of-turn-card-draw to take this card. So timing can be crucial. The game makes for interesting strategic decisions as you work out which colours you are most likely to do well on (as you will definitely not do well in all five colours) If you do not commit any cards to an expedition of a colour, you do not score any minus points for that colour. Courageous players who play a handshake card to an expedition before playing any numbered cards, will double the positive or negative points they score at the end. There are also bonus points to be had if one of your expeditions has eight cards or more, so you also need to ensure you do not allow an opponent to monopolise a colour.

Conclusion: A simple game for two that is full of decisions. You will push your luck starting expeditions when you really have no way of knowing whether you are going to reach the 20 point threshold. The explorer theme is unimportant, its basically just a deck of numbered cards. And occasionally one player might just draw perfect cards for the expeditions they want meaning the other player might feel a bit aggrieved at their lack of luck. But each game is a chance to flex your brain against a pal and its quick enough that you will play it again and then most likely you will play it again, if you have the courage that is.
