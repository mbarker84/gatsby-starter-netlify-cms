Set in some kind of grim dystopian future where all the animals are gone. Red Kites? Dead kites. Wildebeest? Killed beast. Canadian Geese? Rest in peace. Frogs? Croaked. Pelican? Pelican't breathe. All gone that is...except the bears. But the punters, now starved of cutesy, cuddly, sub species to lay their greasy eyeballs on are clamouring to visit zoo's to see bears. And Koalas which technically aren't bears but presumably said they were bears to avoid the mass culling. Luckily for you, you're in the business of bears and, what we shall for purposes of this game call koala ‘bears’.

2 - 4 players will ignore this chaos and each take on the task of transforming a barren park into a Barenpark. You'll begin with a grid of land with a park entrance depicting your unique country flag. A central board holds all the tetris-like park tiles that players will be scrambling for and attempting to place on their park boards.

The types of tiles are as follows:

* Green tiles: Toilets, food streets and rivers. Not home to animals. Not gonna score you any points. But they will helpfully plug the small gaps around your park
* White tiles: The medium size tiles featuring bears. One shape per bear type. (Victory point numbers on the tiles decrease with each one taken)
* Orange tiles: The larger bear prisons, awkward shapes but big points. (Only one tile of each shape)

\
Each player will start with a green tile in their supply. 1st player gets a toilet and sizes increase with each subsequent player.

A turn in Barenpark is simple. Place a tile from your supply on your park board adjacent to a previously placed tile (Your first tile can go anywhere). If you cover one or more icons, do the following:

* Green wheelbarrow icon - Take a green tile and add it to your supply
* White cement truck icon - Take a white tile and add it to your supply.
* Orange digger icon - Take an orange tile and add it to your supply
* Workmen people icon - Take a random empty park board from the supply and extend your park in one direction. You cannot extend on the side where your park entrance is

Players must not cover the space on park boards depicting a hole surrounded by tape. Only when a board is completely covered with tiles, except for the hole space, can that player take the Bear statue with highest points value, amongst those available, and place it on the hole space.



A player can have a maximum of 4 park boards. When a player completes their 4th and final board, other players take a final turn and then the game is over. All players add up the values on all their bear tiles plus those on bear statues. Each game will also have achievements for players to accomplish (You can leave these out if you wish). For example, have 3 polar bear enclosures. Have a long river of 3 uninterrupted river tiles. 3 orange enclosures in your park are all adjacent. As players complete these they will receive more victory points than the next person to achieve it. These are added to a player's score at endgame and the player with the most victory points is the bestest bear park builder in the bloody business Bernard.

Lots-o-huggin or Boo Boo?



Barenpark is one of the easiest games to learn that i have ever encountered. No need to be smarter than the average bear. You play a tile to your board adjacent to a previous tile, ideally wanting to cover up one or more icons. Then you draw the appropriate new tiles or a new park board depending on what icons you covered up. It's that simple. Despite this, it will exercise your brain. You will have plans of what you want to do and try to work out which tiles are best going to accomplish it and in what order you will need to grab them. The key thing about Barenpark that makes it exciting is that the whole thing is a race. You will want to completely fill boards before your opponents so that you get Bear statues worth greater points. You will want to complete the achievements before your opponents because that will earn you greater points. But the achievement might require you to get one of the large orange enclosure tiles, and there isn't an orange icon on the starting park tiles. So you need to quickly expand your park with a new park board and then cover up the orange icon on the new board with a tile, but that means you're neglecting filling up your starting board to grab a bear statue. So players will branch off in different directions but you'll be keeping an eye on how they fare because you will want to beat them to the punch where possible.

This game is perfect for people new to board games. It has a quick setup time, its easy to learn, it's easy to play, has some good decisions for players to make and only takes 30-45 mins. However, the only reason i can imagine a zoo solely focusing on bears would exist, is if all the other animals in the world are gone. And if you can stomach that, then fine, this game is a great buy.



As a final note, these games placing tetris like tiles are becoming more common in the hobby. Barenpark is very similar to another game called Cottage Garden which also has that race-to-cover-boards-with-shapes feel to it. So if the bear theme doesn't quite do it for you, perhaps flower beds and cat tokens might be more in your wheelhouse.
